## Hi 👋, I’m Mohanad Osman

I’m a Software Engineer with hands-on experience building
backend systems and integrating AI models into production web applications.
I’m starting my Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence in Johannes Kepler University in March
and I’m interested in backend, AI, and agentic system roles.
